# Sugar
Sugar is an engine created for the Waffle Project dev projects.

Work in progress engine designed to easily create new java projects.

Warning note that this project is only worked on during my free time. You can use it as you wish but it is not usable yet ! There could be bugs, missing critical features and so on.

This engine is first targeted to create games but I plan on adding features that can help create all type of applications, webhooks, and even more.

The code is not factorized, optimized and documented properly since it is still in its early development stage.

If you wish to contribute to the project feel free to submit an issue to this repositery.
